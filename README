What is Enigma?
===============
Enigma is one of the first fully-featured "suites" for the Windows system monitoring application, [Rainmeter] (http://rainmeter.net/cms/). Created in 2008, the suite has been through many evolutions, and remains popular to this day. It includes numerous contributions from members of the Rainmeter and broader Windows customizing communities.

Features
========
Enigma is for the minimalist, putting flexibility and customization at the core of its design:

* Modular stylesheets allow you to customize fonts, colors, and even the size and shape of your skins. New stylesheets can be created and applied instantly - no need to edit dozens of files.
* Skins are optimized for a "taskbar" or "sidebar" layout. Bar sizes can be adjusted, and skins will automatically adapt to fit. There is even an optional button to hide and reveal the sidebar and all docked skins.
* Most skins cycle through up to six variations on middle-click.
* Dedicated Options config lets you set personal preferences from within Rainmeter. The current skin installer will keep all of your preferences when upgrading or reinstalling.
* Main control panel checks for updates and notifies you when they are available.
* Includes the full range of standard Rainmeter skins, including clocks, notepads, calendars, RSS/Atom feed readers, weather, media player controls, Facebook, Twitter and Remember the Milk displays, recycle bin, network activity, and system resource monitors.
* Also includes three premade themes, which resize themselves to fit your screen resolution.
